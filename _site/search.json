This study puts this theory to the test using data on house prices and train station openings in a Difference-in-Differences setting. Results suggest an average increase in residential house prices of 3.5% to 5% due to a nearby train station opening, indicating a substantial willingness to pay of about 10,000€ for train station access.\n\n\n\n\n\nJan 29, 2024\n\n\nJoschka Flintz\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmission Effects of the 2021 Reformed Motor Vehicle Tax: An Empirical Analysis\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnvironmental\n\n\nTransportation\n\n\nTax\n\n\n\nIn order to combat high emissions in its transportation sector, Germany reformed its tax on vehicle ownerhsip in 2021, increasing the yearly tax burden for owners of new cars with high CO2 emissions. However, an analysis of the tax reform’s impact on car fleet composition and CO2 emissions shows only limited effectiveness in incentivizing individuals to purchase more eco-friendly cars an average tax increase of about 11€ per year leads to a reduction in the average CO2 intesnity of new cars of only 0.74g/km CO2.\n\n\n\n\n\nJan 29, 2024\n\n\nJoschka Flintz\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo matching items\n\n\nYou can find more somewhere here."

    "text": "Hello everybody and welcome to the collection of our research!\nWe are a group of young economic researchers located in the Ruhr area, Germany, connected by friendship, employment and love for doing economic research. Our interests and backgrounds are diverse, ranging from labor and education economics, to regional and urban economics, to trade and development economics to environmental economics. Our research incorporates both classical methods to establish causal inference, and modern machine learning techniques. We work with data from federal sources, geo-located spatial data, survey and mobilephone-app data elicited in field experiments as well as hand-collected data, such as data on train stations and tree coverage.\nSo if you have a few minutes time, just browse our projects, find something interesting, and maybe you can learn something new and exciting!\nBest,\nJoschka, Sven, …"
