I am a PhD student in the in the [RTG Regional Disparities and Economic Policy](https://www.regional-disparities.de/){target="_blank"}, founded by the German Research Foundation, and a research assistant at the chair of [Empirical Economics](https://www2.wiwi.rub.de/en/chairs/empirische-wirtschaftsforschung-en/){target="_blank"} at Ruhr University Bochum.
I have a strong interest for transport economics, environmental economics, as well as regional and urban economics.

In particular, my research so far has focused on

-   Car registration taxes and vehicle demand 
-   Public transport subsidies and mobility behavior
-   Rail infrastructure expansion and car ownership
-   Willingness to pay for passenger rail access

You can find out more about my projects [here](research.qmd).
