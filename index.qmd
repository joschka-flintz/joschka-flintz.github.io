I am a Postdoctoral researcher at the [Thünen-Institute of Rural Economics](https://www.thuenen.de/en/institutes/rural-areas/institute-of-rural-economics){target="_blank"}. 
My research interests are transport economics, environmental economics, as well as regional and urban economics.
I obtained my PhD as part of the [RTG Regional Disparities and Economic Policy](https://www.regional-disparities.de/){target="_blank"}, founded by the German Research Foundation, at Ruhr University Bochum. I am also member of the Research Network of the [RWI](https://www.rwi-essen.de/en/forschung-beratung/weitere/rwi-research-network/team).


In particular, my research so far has focused on

-   Car registration taxes and vehicle demand
