description: Theory postulates that people are willing to pay a premium for living nearby public transportation infrastructure as it enhances a location's accessibility. This study puts this theory to the test using data on house prices and train station openings in a Difference-in-Differences setting. Results suggest an average increase in residential house prices of 3.5% to 5% due to a nearby train station opening, indicating a substantial willingness to pay of about 10,000â‚¬ for train station access.

## Train Stations detemrine distribution of spatial activity

Train stations improve accessibility and therefore people would like to live nearby. This increases demand and translates into an increase in real estate values.

## What is the impact of train stations on house prices?

To answer that question I look at train station openings and use them as a quasi-experiment for identification.

## Very cool findings

Indeed, the results are quite cool.
