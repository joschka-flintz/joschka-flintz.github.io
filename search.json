AStA Wirtschafts-und Sozialstatistisches Archiv (2022)\n\n\nAt the beginning of 2021, the CO2-dependent component of the German vehicle tax was adjusted and made progressive, so that the tax burden for vehicles with high emission intensity increases disproportionately. This paper analyzes the effectiveness of the reformed vehicle tax in terms of its incentive effect and CO2 saving potential using the discrete demand model of Berry et al. (1995). Our estimation results show that with about 21,000 fewer cars sold annually as a result and a reduction in mean CO2 intensity of 0.74g/km, the annual CO2 emissions of newly purchased vehicles fall by about 60,000 tons. This moderate outcome is intuitive: an average tax increase of around 11 euros per annum does not have the steering effect that is needed to substantially reduce emissions. Our simulation results of a fictitious vehicle taxation with more progressive tax rates assumed here, which would result in an average tax increase of around 90 euros, would have significantly stronger effects and reduce the average CO2 emissions per kilometer of new cars by some 5g/km and reduce the number of new registrations by around 195,000 passenger cars. As a result, around 450,000 tons of CO2 might be saved annually. Nevertheless, a comparison with the annual emissions of the car fleet in Germany of around 100 million tons shows that even the effects of the fictitious progressive vehicle tax with higher tax rates would be very limited."

Ruhr Economic Papers (2024)\n\n\nThis study quantifies the effect of train station openings on residential house prices across Germany over a 12-year period to provide generalizable evidence on the valuation of access to passenger rail by households. It is based on data on about 90 train station openings between 2009 and 2020 in Germany and a Difference-in-Differences model that uses three different control group variants to cover alternative assumptions about unobserved regional heterogeneity to mitigate problems arising from endogenous transport infrastructure provision. The results indicate that train station openings increase residential house prices on average by 5% (€18,000) within a distance of up to two to three kilometers. Notably, these positive effects are observed exclusively for properties without prior access to passenger rail services, and are significantly larger in more densely populated and urban areas.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndividual Mobility and Public Transport Subsidies with Mark Andor and Colin Vance. USAEE Working Paper (2025)\n\n\nPoliticians around the world are looking for ways to reduce the negative externalities of the transport sector. Subsidization of public transport is a popular remedy, but evidence on the associated causal effects remains scant. Based on a randomized controlled trial that tracks mobility behavior continuously via a mobile app, this study provides causal evidence on how individuals modify their mobility patterns when provided with temporary cost-free access to public transport. We further explore whether such access induces enduring shifts in mobility behavior after the reinstatement of regular fares. We randomly provide roughly half of our around 420 participants - whose selection targeted car users - with a one-month public transport ticket for their local area, and monitor travel behavior across all modes over three months. We find a statistically significant average increase of about two trips per month using public transport during the subsidization period. The rise in public transport utilization, however, is not paralleled by a reduction in car usage, nor does it yield a persistent alteration in mobility behavior in the subsequent month after the ticket expires.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen Fans Travel: Determinants and Effects of Away Support in Football. Ruhr Economic Papers (2025)\n\n\nThis study examines the determinants of away fan attendance in Germany’s top three football divisions over six seasons and assesses its impact on match outcomes. The analysis reveals that, after conditioning on home and away teams, distance and kick-off time are the most important predictors of away fan turnout. Moreover, away support is found to have a statistically significant positive effect on team performance: an additional 1,000 away fans are associated with a 4.6% to 7.5% increase in the probability of the away team winning or drawing the match. These findings suggest that league organizers should consider fan logistics and the potential influence of away fan presence when scheduling fixtures, in order to maintain sporting equity. At the club level, the results underscore the value of fostering fan engagement and indicate that strategies aimed at increasing away attendance may contribute to improved sporting outcomes."

This study investigates the effects of train stations on private car ownership. We analyze the openings of more than 170 train stations in Germany between 2009 and 2022, comparing them to a control group of locations identified as potential candidates for new stations. The results indicate that car registrations per household permanently decline by 4 to 6 percent in the proximity of a newly opened train station.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLabor market tightness and business successions with Jan Cornelius Peters and Martin Simmler.\n\n\nThis paper studies the causal impact of skilled labor shortage on business successions, particularly on their failure resulting in firm exits. We outline an illustrative search model of managerial succession and empirically assess its implications using firm level trade registry information from 2013 to 2023 combined with survey data on labor market tightness at the level of region-sector cells. Identification exploits the increasing propensity to resign as owner-managers approach retirement age. The results indicate that tighter labor markets significantly raise the likelihood of firm exit among firms led by older managers. Specifically, a one-standard-deviation increase in labor market tightness increases the probability of firm exit by 2.1 percentage points for firms with managers older than 50 years. Conditional on manager resignation, this corresponds to an increase in firms’ exit probability of approximately 13 percentage points."
